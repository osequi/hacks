# Frameworks

## CRA

- Much more easier to go with CRA than with CNA.

## Next.js

- The only advantage is Vercel / deploying.
- Otherwise is complicated.

### JS

- Has no support for .... `array.flat()` .... !!!!

### CSS in JS

- `styled-components` need a `.babelrc` file to work
- `material-ui` again needs a dirty hack which isn't working all the time: https://itnext.io/next-js-with-material-ui-7a7f6485f671

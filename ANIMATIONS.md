## Anime.js

- 36k stars
- Very nice and easy
- Cannot combine initial transforms (`rotateY: 90deg`) of an element with a later keyframes animation addition (`translateX from -100 to 100`)

## Framer Motion

- 7k stars
- Very complex features like gesture control and so on
- Syntax is React-like
- It seemed more complicated than Anime.js

## React Spring 

- 18k stars
- The syntax is so complicated. I couldn't create a simple keyframes transitions like at https://css-tricks.com/how-css-perspective-works/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-427&utm_medium=email
